# PWA Budget Tracker  
![badge](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Budget&message=PWA&color=green)  
## Description  
This is a Full-Stack Progressive Web Application utilizing HTML/CSS JavaScript, node.js, express, compression,  
and MongoDB.  This database is hosted on Heroku.  
I used Mongo Atlas to make the database consistent framework for  
the design.  This application allows you to keep track of your purchases and  
to add to your backlog of games that you still need to beat,  
read from the database to determine whether or not the item in the  
database has already been completed or not and position them in their coresponding UL.  
### SHOUTOUTS!
